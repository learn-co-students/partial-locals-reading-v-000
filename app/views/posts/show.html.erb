<!-- passing a hash with two key-value pairs. -->
<!--The first key-value pair tells Rails the name of the partial to render. The second key-value pair contains a key of locals pointing to a hash of variables to pass into the partial. When we use locals, we need to make sure that the variables we refer to in our partial have the same names as the keys in our locals hash.  -->
