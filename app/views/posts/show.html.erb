Information About the Post
<!--
Because we are calling a partial from outside the current app/views/posts folder,
we must specify the folder that our author partial is coming from by calling render 'authors/author'
<%= render 'authors/author' %>
-->
<!--
We are no longer passing the render method a String; we're passing a Hash with two key-value pairs
The first key-value pair tells Rails the name of the partial to render
The second key-value pair points itself to another Hash. That Hash contains a key of locals pointing to values that will be assigned to them as local variables within the partial.
-->
<%= render partial: "authors/author", locals: {post_author: @author} %>
<%= @post.title %>
<%= @post.content %>
